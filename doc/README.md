# Documentation for Building the Conference

Congratulations, or commiserations, on being asked to organise AISTATS. Organising a conference is one of the most helpful things you can do for a research community. But if it's your first time organising a conference, it can also be one of the most stressful. 

The aim of this document is to ease that stress. It integrates a checklist of things you need to do and explains how to update this website once they're done.

The first two things can be done in parallel.

1. You need to find a venue and set the dates [./venue.md](venue).
2. You need to [./committees.md](build your organisation team).

You should start on these two jobs as soon as you have agreed to run the conference.
